# LT2212 V19 Assignment 2

From Asad Sayeed's statistical NLP course at the University of Gothenburg.

My name: Iris Epple

## Additional instructions

gendoc: 
2 additional optional arguments: Two csv files, one for each topic, to use as input for simdoc. Name the files
according to the subfolders and in alphabetical order.

simdoc: takes two csv files as input

Reduced the number of articles to 300 in each topic.


## Results and discussion



### Vocabulary restriction.

I chose 20, to get a few more than the obvious ones (i.e. the stop words).

### Result table
